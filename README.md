# TypeTypeType

A typing speed testing app.

## Ideas 

- Maybe add Zustand to this project for state management - https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand

## Features

- Add a graph of user type speed
- change from word specific correctness to letter correctness
- user accounts
- Leaderboard
- test word color chagne for right/wrong words. green/red kinda thing.

## Needs fixin'

- Style the start button
- Add footer
- Add header
- text contrast. hard to read text.

## fixed

- Clicking start button should focus the input
- bug - when the line changes the focus word in at index 1 instead of zero
- 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
